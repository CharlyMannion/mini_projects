# Mini Applications

The aim of these challenges is to practice writing applications using object oriented design.

Each challenge has a collection of user stories, and example of how the user will interact with the application via the command line. The problems have all been picked because they are suited to object oriented design, and the user stories tend to increase in complexity as you progress through them.

If you complete all the given user stories for a challenge, feel free to extend the application by adding your own!

When solving these challenges you should focus on:
- Clean code that retains readability
- Test driving development, using both feature and unit tests
- Incremental development
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Encapsulate your code, focusing on the interfaces between units

## Guidance

Choose a challenge and implement the user stories until you run out of features or get bored!

Once you have a feature-rich, well structured command line application there are many ways you could take any of these challenges further:

  1) Build a web front end for the user interaction

  2) Hook the application up to a database

  3) Add user authentication

  4) Use your imagination to extend the functionality!

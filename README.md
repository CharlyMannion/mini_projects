# Mini Projects

A collection of kata and small projects to help strengthen your coding skills.

## How to use

The kata are split into groups of increasing complexity. However, they are language agnostic and your solution should always be test driven.

The kata are designed to be repeated, to practice test-driving and de-bugging code. The small projects are designed to be breakable toys that can be used to explore a concept in more detail.
